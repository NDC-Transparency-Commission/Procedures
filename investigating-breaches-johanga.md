Procedure Overview for investigating breaches of the NDC Community Code of Conduct

1. Understanding the Code of Conduct: Ensure that all parties involved understand the NDC Community Code of Conduct. This includes both the complainant and the accused. It is essential that they are aware of the specific rules, expected behaviours, and consequences outlined in the code.

2. Documentation: In the event of a potential breach, document all relevant information, including the date, time, location, and individuals involved. This documentation should also include any communication, messages, or evidence related to the incident.

3. Anonymity and Confidentiality: Respect the complainant's anonymity and the confidentiality of the reporting process. Ensure that the Transparency Commission (TC) handles the information with care and doesn't disclose the identities of those involved without their explicit consent.

4. Complaint Submission: If someone witnesses or experiences a breach of the code, they should use the official General Investigation/Report Form provided by the Transparency Commission to submit their complaint. The form should be easily accessible and user-friendly.

5. Investigation: The Transparency Commission is responsible for conducting a thorough and impartial investigation into the reported breach. This investigation should include gathering evidence, interviewing all relevant parties, and assessing the severity of the violation.

6. Severity Assessment: The TC should determine the severity of the breach based on the provided evidence and the context of the incident. Consider whether the breach is a minor infraction or a more serious offense. Different consequences may apply based on the severity.

7. Consequences: The TC should consider the appropriate consequences for the breach based on the severity and frequency of violations. Consequences may range from warnings and temporary suspensions to permanent expulsion from the community. The TC should make sure that consequences are consistent with the guidelines outlined in the Code of Conduct.

8. Conflict Resolution: If possible, the TC should facilitate a resolution between the parties involved. This may involve mediation, apologies, or other actions to address the harm caused and restore trust within the community.

9. Consultation with Near Foundation Moderation Team: The TC should collaborate with the Near Foundation moderation team when necessary, particularly in cases where posts on the gov.near platform are involved. Decisions regarding post removal or restoration should be made in consultation with NF Mods.

10. Regular Updates and Reviews: The TC should periodically review and update the Code of Conduct to ensure it remains relevant and effective. As the community evolves, new issues may arise, and the code should adapt accordingly.

11. Non-Retroactive Application: It's important to note that the Code of Conduct should not be applied retroactively to cases that arose before October 6th, 2023. New revisions of the code should not have retroactive effects.

12. Communication: Transparent communication is crucial throughout the process. The TC should keep the complainant and the accused informed about the progress of the investigation, findings, and any actions taken.

13. Respect for Due Process: Ensure that the process is fair and respects due process rights for all parties involved. This includes giving the accused an opportunity to respond to the allegations and present their side of the story.

14. Consistency and Fairness: Apply the Code of Conduct consistently and fairly to all community members, regardless of their status or position within the community. No one should receive special treatment or be exempt from the consequences of their actions.

By following these guidelines, the NDC community can effectively assess breaches of the Code of Conduct, maintain a respectful and inclusive environment, and ensure accountability for violations.
