# Conflict of Interest Disclosure and Management Process



1. User Discloses Conflict of Interest:
    * Any member of the NEAR Digital Collective (NDC) or its associated bodies (House of Merit, Council of Advisors, Marketing DAO, Creatives DAO, etc.) who becomes aware of a conflict of interest should initiate the _disclosure process_.
    * Users can disclose conflicts by submitting a Conflict of Interest D isclosure Form to the Transparency Commission (TC). This form should include the following information:
        * User's name and contact information.
        * Nature and details of the conflict of interest.
        * How the user is currently managing the conflict.
2. Transparency Commission (TC) Review:
    * The TC is responsible for reviewing all conflict of interest disclosures in a reasonable timeframe. 
    * Upon receiving a disclosure, the TC should conduct a thorough review of the information provided and any supporting documents.
    * The TC may request additional information or clarification from the user if needed.
3. Evaluation and Decision:
    * The TC evaluates the disclosed conflict based on established criteria, such as the impact on the NDC's activities, transparency, and integrity.
    * The TC may categorize conflicts based on their severity and potential impact, e.g., low, medium, or high.
4. Conflict Management Plan:
    * For conflicts categorized as low or medium, the TC may work with the user to develop a conflict management plan. This plan should outline how the user will handle the conflict to minimize its impact on NDC activities.
    * The user's proposed conflict management plan should be reviewed and approved by the TC. It may include actions such as recusal from specific decision-making processes, transparency measures, or other steps to mitigate the conflict.
5. Escalation of Severe Conflicts:
    * For conflicts categorized as high and those that cannot be resolved through a conflict management plan, the TC may escalate the matter to the appropriate authority within the NDC or related body, such as the House of Merit or Council of Advisors.
    * In cases where a conflict poses a significant risk to the NDC's integrity or transparency, the TC may recommend recusal of the user from relevant activities or removal from the role.
6. Communication and Reporting:
    * The TC maintains a record of all disclosed conflicts, their categorization, and the management plans or actions taken.
    * Periodically, the TC may provide reports to the NDC and associated bodies on the status and resolution of conflicts of interest.
7. User Responsibilities:
    * Users who have disclosed conflicts of interest are responsible for implementing and adhering to the conflict management plan approved by the TC.
    * They should keep the TC informed of any changes or updates related to the conflict or its management.
