Guidelines for Assessing Breaches of Incompetence Metrics

1. Understanding Metrics and Obligations: Ensure that all HoM, CoA, and TC members understand their specific obligations, including meeting attendance, voting on proposals, and, for HoM, proposal creation. Members should be aware of the target percentages and the implications of failure.

2. Documentation and Tracking: Maintain a clear and accurate record of each member's activity, including meeting attendance, voting records, and proposal creation. Utilize the Click Up CRM platform for tracking and record-keeping.

3. Regular Reports: Point of Contacts (Elliot Mayer for HoM, Evangel S. for CoA) should provide weekly reports to the Transparency Commission. These reports should include details on members' engagement in daily routine task performance, participation in calls with grassroots DAOs, working group reports, and other relevant activities.

4. Performance Review: Periodically review the performance of HoM, CoA, and TC members based on the established metrics. Assess their compliance with meeting attendance, voting participation, and proposal creation as applicable.

5. Non-Discrimination: Ensure that all performance assessments are conducted without discrimination or bias. Treat all members equally and fairly in accordance with the established metrics.

6. Removal Process: If a member fails to meet the metrics, initiate the removal process as outlined in the NDC Governance Framework. 

7. Transparency and Accountability: Maintain transparency throughout the process of assessing and addressing breaches of the incompetence metrics. This includes communicating the reasons for removal if it becomes necessary.

8. Regular Review and Updates: Periodically review the competence metrics to ensure they remain relevant and effective. 

By following these guidelines, the community can effectively assess breaches of incompetence for HoM, CoA, and TC members, maintain accountability, and ensure that all members fulfill their obligations to the community.
